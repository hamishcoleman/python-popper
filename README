I needed a simple pop server to test a pop client.  Unfortunately, the debian
package "fakepop" has been removed from the repositories.  So, I looked for
and found
    https://code.activestate.com/recipes/534131-pypopper-python-pop3-server/

Unfortunately, it had a couple of bugs, so I have imported it into this repo

This tool now supports multiple messages and you should be able to point it
at a maildir with "pypopper.py $maildir/cur/* $maildir/new/*"
